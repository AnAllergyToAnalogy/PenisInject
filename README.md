# PenisInject
A hard to detect, single line of Javascript which will slowly replace everything on a webpage with the word "penis".

Once every 10 seconds, a random DOM element will be selected, and it's innerText changed to "penis", using fromCharCode so that a find-and-replace for "penis" will not reveal the cause. Minified to decrease detectability.

Intended to be used for pranking purposes between developers only.
